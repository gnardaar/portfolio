                            There could be said already about my journey into programming, but I will start with the
                            basics.
                            I always have to be doing some sort of project. I'm lucky to say I was born and raised in
                            Littleton Colorado. I have big plans for the future, although no one can know past the
                            present tense. Having found
                            myself with many new goals to achieve and I couldn't be more enthused and ready.
                            Getting to understand me is simple and easy. I love to snowboard and skateboard,
                            I would say I/'m all right at it, but
                            now that/'s saying something in this day and age. it is as if though learning tricks in
                            these sports is a lot like learning programming. Right now I Live in a great atmosphere for
                            learning with my roommates; Zack, Jeff, and my cousin Joey. I love these people with all my
                            heart.

                            <p>
                                There is a lesson said by one of my favorite characters in all of the film and that/'s,
                                "There is no try...Only do, or do not."-Yoda. Following this principle, I was able to
                                learn probably one of the hardest lifestyles in the world, skateboarding. The massive
                                skill in the sport and the programming industry has to be one of the closest things that
                                I could compare skateboarding with programming. Programming in a sense is so much like
                                skateboarding. With skating at my best, I can achieve great style and ease, but with
                                that comes consequences and dire cautions. At any moment I must think of the best
                                outcome at all times to avoid injuries. Believing the impossible is the most crucial
                                aspect of skateboarding, along with close attention to detail. Now, most people have
                                seen wins and losses in skateboarding. Frustrations come with the territory, and it may
                                seem all hope is gone once you fail. But, what I have learned through the family which
                                is in the skateboarding community, gives me that extra push to persevere and move
                                forward. I could not count how many times I have picked myself up bloody and dirty. What
                                I do know is that I did it every time without exemption! If it wasn't for skating then I
                                would never find myself striving to achieve the impossible every day. I take a unique
                                perspective on life that allows me to free my mind of fear and doubt, and to see what
                                needs to happen. I guess my attitude to programming is a lot like my personal take on
                                skating: I am a tenacious individual! I know that the world will never know what
                                struggles I had to deal with, but in the end, I conquered them individually. Find the
                                beauty in the practice, and most importantly... Never! Under any circumstances give up!
