                        <p class="about-me">
                            There could be said already about my journey into programming, but I will start with the
                            basics.
                            I always have to be doing something. I'm lucky to say I was born and raised in
                            Littlton Colorado. Could not beleive that it has been 28 years so far. Having found
                            myself with many new goals to acheive and I couldn't be more enthused.
                            Getting to under stand me is simple and easy. I'm ready for the future and everything
                            that it has to bring at me. I love to snowboard and skateboard,
                            I would say Im alright at it,
                            now thats saying something in this day and age wit.
                            I live right now with Three other roomates; Zack, Jeff, and my cousin Joey. I love the
                            the people I'm with and I need them in my life. but I am really trying to find
                            everything that
                            I can find outside of colorado. To me there is more wonder in life than just the Rocky
                            Mountains .

                <h1 class="title-b">Flying Lessons</h1>
                <strong><small>

                        <article class="fly">
                            <p>
                                There is a lesson said by one
                                of my favorite characters in all of film and thats,
                                "There
                                is no try...Only do, or do not."-Yoda. Following this pricipal,
                                I was able to learn probably one of the hardest lifestyles in the world,
                                skateboarding.
                                The massive skill in the industry, along with style, has to be one of
                                the closest things that I could compare programming to. Programming in a since, is
                                so
                                much like skateboarding. Whith skating
                                at the fullest potential I can achieve great style and ease, but with that comes
                                consequences and dire cautions. At any moment I must think of the best out come
                                all times. Believing the impossible is the most crutial aspect to skateboarding,
                                along with close attention to detail. Now most people have seen wins and losses
                                in skateboarding. Frustrations
                                come with the territory and it may just seem all hope is gone once you failed. But,
                                what
                                I have learned through the family wich is in the skateboarding comunity, gives me
                                that
                                extra push to persivere and move
                                forward. Personally I could not count how many times I have picked myself up bloody
                                and
                                dirty. What I do know is that I did it everytime without excemption! If it wasn't
                                for
                                skating then I would never find myself
                                striving to acheive the impossible everyday. I take a unique perspective on life
                                that
                                allows me to free my mind of fear and doubt, to see what really needs to happen. I
                                guess
                                what attitude I take to programming is
                                a lot like my personal take with skating is this, I am a tanacious individual! I
                                know
                                that the world will never know what struggles I really had to deal with, but in the
                                end
                                I conquered them individually. Find the beauty in the practice, and most
                                importantly...
                                Never! Under any circumstances give up!
